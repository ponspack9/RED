Red is a platformer game where the player, as Red, has to avoid the pursuers black 
niggas to reach the final door and get to the end and keep avoiding black niggas
which are very fast and annoying.
For the Assignment 2 we have implemented its pathfinding and the core object of these 
enemies among other things.
